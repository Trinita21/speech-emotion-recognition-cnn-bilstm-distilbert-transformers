## Overview
This project implements **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** using a  **CNN, BiLSTM** and **DistilBERT** for text-based emotion analysis. The data was taken from the paper: Multimedia content analysis for emotional characterization of music video clips (Yazdani et al., 2013). Link: https://jivp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1687-5281-2013-26 . The model processes both speech signals and textual transcriptions to classify emotions effectively. The project is implemented in a **Google Colab Notebook** for ease of use and accessibility.

## Features
- üé§ Extracts features from speech audio
- üß† Combines **CNN-BiLSTM** for speech-based emotion recognition
- üìù Uses **DistilBERT** for text-based emotion understanding
- üî¨ Trains and evaluates models in **Google Colab**

## Google Colab Notebook
Run the notebook directly on **Google Colab**:
